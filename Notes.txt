I am trying to make a "minimal" MFC SDI app. At project creation, I unchecked everything I could. I am also deleting or commenting-out code to see if it will still run. The project built and ran as created.
The window does not have maximize, minimize or exit buttons. It does have file, edit, and help menu items, and a toolbar with menu icons for new, open, save, cut, copy, paste, print and about.
Apparently, several things in CMainFrame need the registry key to be set in CMFCSDIminimalApp::InitInstance().
